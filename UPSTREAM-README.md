You control a fly by firing real **descending neurons** in the
[FlyWire](https://flywire.ai) connectome. The spike cascade propagates through
the real wiring, into a real fly's spinal cord, and what comes out of the spine
is a walking magnitude and a turn bias. Those two numbers modulate a hand-written
tripod gait and — with the kinematic assist that ships on by default — are also
written straight into the body's velocity. The connectome simulation is real and
runs on the GPU every frame; the locomotion layered on top of it is an
approximation, and every approximation and shortcut is inventoried in
[`LIMITATIONS.md`](./LIMITATIONS.md).

**What this is**

- A whole-animal *Drosophila* nervous system — brain, spinal cord, and body — running end-to-end in a browser tab on WebGPU, no install and no server.
- Two real connectomes (FlyWire brain + Janelia MANC spine) simulated as leaky integrate-and-fire networks, with gather, integrate, threshold and reset fused into a single LIF kernel per timestep.
- A physically simulated fly body (TuragaLab flybody in MuJoCo/WASM) driven by a hand-written tripod gait that the spine's motor output scales, with a retina feeding vision back into the brain.
- A game with **replay-as-URL**: a shared link re-fires your keystrokes at the same simulation steps, so the identical neuron cascade re-runs against the same connectome and the same seeded target.

</td>
<td valign="top" width="33%">

**What this isn't**

- **Not a scientific simulator replacement.** NEST / Brian2 / NEURON are faster, biophysically detailed, and validated. For real fly-brain dynamics research, use those.
- **Not biophysically detailed.** Neurons are LIF with a two-state alpha synapse — no ion channels, dendritic compartments, or neuromodulation.
- **Not quantitatively validated** whole-brain. The one dynamics check is Kenyon-cell sparsity in the canonical 5–15% band — and `w_syn` was tuned to land it there (`src/sim.ts:25-30`), so it is a calibration target, not an independent validation of Shiu et al. 2024.
- **Not faster than the reference.** It runs *slower* than real time. The win is reachability, not throughput. See [`LIMITATIONS.md`](./LIMITATIONS.md).

</td>
<td valign="top" width="33%">

**Who it's for**

- **The curious public.** A real animal brain you can poke, with a 30-second time-to-first-spike and no setup.
- **Educators.** Every key fires a named command neuron and you watch the consequence ripple to the legs — the connectome made tangible.
- **Connectome / WebGPU folks.** A real ~140k-neuron LIF kernel benchmarked honestly in the browser, with the brain→spine path wired from real biology.
- **Anyone who wants reproducibility.** Runs are URLs; a replay link is a verifiable brain trace, not a video.

## 🏠 Fly Habitat (connectome-house)

`world.html` is a living-connectome habitat built on this stack: the full FlyWire brain runs on WebGPU, its bilateral olfactory and optic populations are driven by odor plumes and the fly's own rendered retina, and a learned steering policy plus a goal readout (both real reinforcement learners, inherited across generations) move the flybody through a house where it eats, drinks, sleeps, forages, lays eggs and dies. The page shows every neuron's live activity, a spike strip of named descending neurons, per-population left|right rates, and a lineage chart. See [HABITAT.md](HABITAT.md) for what is measured versus authored, and [CONNECTOME-HOUSE.md](CONNECTOME-HOUSE.md) for the circuit laboratory.

## ▶ Play

Each key fires both copies of a famous descending neuron (DN). Race the fly to
the red target in the least **time × spikes**.

```
Q DNa01    forward         A DNp01    escape jump     Z RRN     forward step
W DNa02    forward, faster S DNp09    looming-evoked  X BPN     forward
E DNb01    backward        D DNp52    forward circuit
R DNg13    turning         F MDN      backward
                                                       SPACE     new round
                                                       M         science view
```

Win → copy the replay URL. The recipient's brain re-runs the **identical**
cascade — your keystrokes replayed at the same simulation steps, against the
same connectome and the same seeded target. The body trajectory can drift: the
physics advances a fixed number of substeps per animation frame, so it depends
on display refresh rate. Daily-challenge mode uses the same target seed for
everyone on the same UTC day.

The landing page at [`/`](https://webgpu-fly.pages.dev) explains the project in
plain language; the simulator itself lives at
[`/app`](https://webgpu-fly.pages.dev/app). Append `?mode=science` (or press
`M` in game) for the researcher interface: stim presets, closed-loop visual
mode, ARS evolver, raw spike-rate log.

## 🧠 What's actually inside

| Layer | Source | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| **Brain** | [FlyWire FAFB](https://flywire.ai/) connectome (Dorkenwald et al. 2024, *Nature*) | 139,255 neurons, ~15M synaptic edges, two-state alpha-synapse LIF on WebGPU |
| **Spine** | [Janelia MANC](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem/manc-connectome) connectome (Takemura et al. 2024) | 23,188 VNC neurons, 5.2M edges, second WebGPU LIF instance |
| **Body** | [TuragaLab/flybody](https://github.com/TuragaLab/flybody) MJCF (Vaxenburg et al. 2025, *Nature*) | 67 bodies, 111 actuators, real physics in MuJoCo/WASM |
| **Eyes** | offscreen render-to-texture from fly head pose | 64×16 retinal sample fed to brain optic neurons |
| **Walker** | trained RL policy ([Vaxenburg et al. 2025 Figshare](https://janelia.figshare.com/articles/dataset/25309105)) | LayerNormMLP, 741-dim obs → 59 actions, pure-TS forward pass. Translates the body under physics with the kinematic assist **off** — 2.004–2.021 cm per simulated second against a 2.0 cm/s command. It stays upright (+0.997) only with the pitch/roll damper on; with the damper off it capsizes and covers 0.068 cm/sim s. Checked element-wise against a numpy re-run of the same extracted weights (`tools/verify_walking_policy.py`) — that validates the port's arithmetic, not the assumed architecture against the original SavedModel |

Brain → spine wiring is by **cell-type name match** (`DNa01` in the brain is the
same neuron as `DNa01` in the VNC — brain side has the soma, VNC side the axon).
That path — sensory drive → brain LIF → named DNs → VNC LIF — is a real spike
cascade across two real connectomes, with nothing learned or scripted in it.
Below the spine it is an approximation: the VNC's 369 leg motor neurons are
averaged into six leg-group means, and those become a walking magnitude and a
turn bias (the forward/backward sign is not MANC's — it comes from the
hand-wired synthetic spine in `src/vnc.ts`). Those two scalars scale a
hand-written tripod CPG (`driveLegs`, `src/physics.ts`) that writes the leg
actuators. The connectome scales that gait; it does not generate its rhythm, and
the leg phase itself is `sin(sim_time · freq)`. (Caveat: it's a name join across two *different* animals'
connectomes, not a reconstructed synaptic bridge — see
[`LIMITATIONS.md`](./LIMITATIONS.md) §5.)

The **trained RL walking policy** is a separate path, and its *translation* is
earned: with the kinematic assist off nothing on that path writes the body's
translational velocity, so the 2.004–2.021 cm per simulated second it covers
against a 2.0 cm/s command comes from leg actuation and ground reaction, while a
run with the policy never enabled travels 0.032 cm/sim s. Its *attitude* is not
earned. A pitch/roll damper that sits outside the assist multiplies the body's
pitch and roll angular velocity by 0.85 every substep (`src/physics.ts:663-666`,
×0.039 per control tick); with that damper off the same policy capsizes and
covers 0.068 cm/sim s. So the +0.997 uprightness is the damper's doing, not the
policy's.
That path also bypasses the brain and the spine entirely — it is Vaxenburg et
al.'s published policy walking the fly, not the connectome.
[`LIMITATIONS.md`](./LIMITATIONS.md) §4.1 has the damper A/B, the numbers, and
the four port defects that had to be fixed to get there.

## ⏱️ How fast — honestly

The brain LIF kernel is **memory-bandwidth-bound**, not compute-bound, and runs
at **~0.25 kHz** of biological time on an M2 Pro (16 GB). That is **4× slower
than real time**. We measured against the scientific standards on the **same
machine**:

| Engine | Biological-time rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| NEST 3.10 (C++ reference) | **0.67 kHz** | `tools/nest_bench.py` |
| Hand-written Rust (multicore) | **0.45 kHz** | `tools/cpu-bench/` |
| **webgpu-fly (WebGPU)** | **0.25 kHz** | `npm run bench:brain` |

The 1 kHz target from the project's original design note turned out to be
**unreachable for all three** on M2 Pro. We report what we measured, not what we
hoped. The point of webgpu-fly was never "faster than NEST" — it's **a real fly
brain on a phone in 30 seconds**, the deployment angle the others can't touch.

## 🆚 How it compares

Roughly the same idea as:

- [EON Systems](https://eon.systems) (March 2026) — also FlyWire LIF + flybody MuJoCo, but server-side and closed.
- [FlyGM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17997) (NeurIPS 2025) — connectome-as-GNN controller, Python.
- [NeuroMechFly v2 / flygym](https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/flygym) (Nature Methods 2024) — Python pip package.

Differentiators: **(1)** a browser-tab game with a URL — the others need Python,
a GPU, and a setup hour; **(2)** all three layers (brain + spine + body) wired
together, not just brain+body; **(3)** replay-as-URL — every shared run is a
re-executable brain trace, not a video.

## ⏱️ Quickstart (local dev)

```bash
# One-time Python env (numpy/pandas/pyarrow for the connectomes, TF for the policy)
uv venv .venv-tf && uv pip install --python .venv-tf/bin/python numpy pandas pyarrow tensorflow

# Brain (~855 MB FlyWire pull from Zenodo)
bash tools/download_data.sh
.venv-tf/bin/python tools/build_csr.py        # → public/brain.bin (120 MB)

# Spine (~88 MB MANC pull from Janelia GCS)
bash tools/download_manc.sh
.venv-tf/bin/python tools/build_vnc.py        # → public/vnc.bin (43 MB)

# Trained walking policy (~6.5 MB Janelia Figshare)
bash tools/download_flybody_policies.sh
.venv-tf/bin/python tools/extract_walking_policy.py

# TuragaLab flybody MJCF + 85 OBJ meshes (~149 MB) — not redistributed here (Apache-2.0, see NOTICE)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/TuragaLab/flybody /tmp/flybody
cp /tmp/flybody/flybody/fruitfly/assets/*.obj public/flybody/
.venv-tf/bin/python tools/bake_flybody_bundle.py   # → public/flybody.bundle.bin

npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:8766
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit          ← what CI enforces
npm run build        # tsc && vite build     ← what CI enforces
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright (game + science modes) — needs WebGPU + assets
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `typecheck` + `build` on Ubuntu. The
Playwright e2e suite is **not** in CI — it needs a WebGPU-capable Chromium and
~1 GB of assets, neither of which the default runners provide. It runs locally
and covers both game and science modes (KC sparsity, DN cascade, retina
detection, RL walker translation, replay roundtrip, daily-challenge).

## 🚀 Deploy

[`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md) covers the full Cloudflare Pages + R2 path. The root
`/` is a lightweight landing page; the app is at `/app`. Heavy assets
(`brain.bin`, `vnc.bin`, flybody, `walking-policy.bin`) live in R2 because
Cloudflare Pages caps individual files at 25 MB; Pages serves the ~9 MB JS+WASM
bundle. `npm run deploy` builds slim and pushes to Pages; `npm run deploy:r2`
uploads the binaries. Caching is transparent-invalidation via a sha manifest
(`tools/write_manifest.py` → `?v=<sha>`); see DEPLOY.md.
